Here, we can click on Terminal, confirm our pairing phrase, set a password and connect to Lightning Terminal.

We can use this interface to see our channels and their status, incoming and outgoing payments, our balance, open channels, find other nodes, perform Loops, buy and sell channels on Pool or set our channel fees.
