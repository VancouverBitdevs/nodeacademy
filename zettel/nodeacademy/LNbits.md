In this optional session, we are going to install LNbits. LNbits is an accounting system with countless useful functionalities. It allows you to "open" your node to others, such as family and friends, who can each have their own custodial wallet, you being the custodian. You can connect your LNbits wallet to Bluewallet or Zeus, and install countless extensions, many of which make use of LNURLs.
