To obtain our node's IP address, we can click in the top right corner, then the network we are connected to, then Settings and finally we should see an overview of our connection, including our node's IPv4 address. It may look like this: `192.168.1.110`. We will remember it.

If you prefer to use the command line you can run `hostname -I` to list your IPv4 address.
