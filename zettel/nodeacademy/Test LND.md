We can test our installation and connection with the command:

```shell
litd
```

If it doesn't stop or crash with an error, great! **We've completed our configuration process!**

You can stop the process by pressing `Ctrl` + `C`. That should send the shutdown signal and `litd` should shut down gracefully.
