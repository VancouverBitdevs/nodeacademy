First, you will need to create an account. You'll be asked for an email address, password and a country. They will later require a phone number for verification, so if you are using a service like [SMS4SATS](https://sms4sats.com/), plan ahead!

**Your security is important:** If you signed up with a phone number that isn't yours, make sure this phone number isn't automatically added to your account for recovery purposes. Under _Account_ in the top panel, you can opt into two-factor authentication. I recommend "time-based one-time password".
### Deposit funds into your account

We will have to deposit some funds into our account. Under _Billing_ in the top panel we can make a lump-sum payment into our account. Try adding US$5 via BTCPay (Lightning) if you already have a mobile Lightning wallet.
