Tor is a public relay network that helps us to both anonymize our node's location, as well as be able to accept incoming connections through a "Tor Hidden Service." Even if our node is running on clearnet, installing Tor is often useful, as it allows to reach Tor-only nodes and make ourselves available through a hidden service, which can make connections to Tor nodes more reliable.
