Zeus is a mobile Lightning wallet for iOS and Android. We recommend connecting to Zeus over LNC if your node is behind Tor. If your node is accessible over clearnet, we recommend connecting over REST instead (see instructions below).

We go back to the `litd` interface, where we find "Lightning Node Connect" on the left hand side.

We can select "Create a new session", give it a label (e.g. "Zeus) and give it permissions. If it's your own wallet, you might be okay with "Admin". If you are using the wallet purely to receive, try out "Read-only".

You will now have the option to show the QR code and scan it with Zeus. In Zeus, add a new account by navigating to the Zeus symbol on the top left, then clicking on your current node, then on the plus symbol on the top right. Now a square on the top right should indicate the ability to scan the QR code. Give it a name and hit "save config". You should now be able to connect to it, see your balance, create invoices and make payments.
