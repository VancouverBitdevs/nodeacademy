We recommend setting up a VPS with [Lunanode](https://www.lunanode.com/), a solid hosting provider based in Toronto, Ontario. We recommend them partly because we've been running a Lightning node there for several years, and partly because they accept Lightning payments directly into their own node. For the purpose of running a Lightning Node, you may choose any other provider, given they can give you full ssh access to a Linux instance.

Other popular providers that accept Lightning are [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/vps/), [Cherryservers](https://www.cherryservers.com/), [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/) or [Bitlaunch](https://bitlaunch.io/) (reselling Digital Ocean).
