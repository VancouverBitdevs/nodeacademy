To install Ubuntu, we will first need to make a live USB.

- We will need a USB drive with at least 4GB of space (8GB is better). This can be any USB except for one made by Sandisk.
- We are going to download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) for Windows. If you are already using Ubuntu or Mac OS X, you do not need to download additional software.
- The Ubuntu installation file can be found [here](https://ubuntu.com/download). We recommend downloading **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**.

To install Ubuntu on your spare machine, you will need to access the BIOS. This is typically done by pressing a specific button, such as the Enter button, F1 or F12 at startup. The startup screen should be able to give you a hint as to which button to press. Searching for "Access BIOS" together with your make and model number will also typically yield helpful results.

Next, we will plug in the live USB we created in the previous step and instruct the BIOS to boot from it. Often this is called "temporary boot partition." We should now be able to confirm our selection, which should let us leave BIOS and boot into Ubuntu.

Finally, we are going to follow the instructions on screen. These include setting our time zone, a name for our device and user, as well as a password. We recommend to install the operating system on the entire partition. **This will wipe everything on the hard disk**, so be prepared. We do not recommend running Ubuntu alongside Windows for the purpose of a Lightning Network node.

As part of the installation process, we can also already connect the computer to the internet and apply all recent updates.
