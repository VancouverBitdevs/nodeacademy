In our Lunanode account, under _Account_, we can find the option _SSH Keys_. We can add our SSH key there. Give it a name (ideally the name of the computer that belongs to this key), paste your public key into the appropriate field and add it.

You can add multiple SSH keys here, for example if you want to access your server both from your desktop and laptop computer. Just repeat the steps above and add the two keys separately into your Lunanode account. Be careful to only add the **public** keys: they end with `.pub`.
