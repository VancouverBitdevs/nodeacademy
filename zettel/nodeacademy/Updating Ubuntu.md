Applying all recent updates is easy. We only need to run the following two commands consecutively and type `Y` then prompted:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Depending on what kind of updates we are getting we might have to confirm a few other prompts. Going with the defaults is generally fine for our purpose, so pressing the `Enter` key is enough.

Occasionally our machine will ask us to restart it. This is not urgent, but can be done with the command:

```shell
sudo reboot now
```
