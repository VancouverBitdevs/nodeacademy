Lightning Terminal has the ability to create custodial sub account on your node. This is incredibly handy if you are uncomfortable walking around with the keys to your full node, or want to give your family and friends access to your channel liquidity. Why should they trust some far away wallet when they can trust you, right?

In the litd UI under "Lightning Node Connect", give your connection a name and choose "Custom". On the left, choose "Custodial Account", add a balance (e.g. 1 sat) and hit "Submit". You can share the connection phrase or the QR code with your friend. They can then start using your node to receive and send payments without seeing your balance or transactions.
