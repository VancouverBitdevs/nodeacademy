We will create a a superuser. As we only just started LNbits, we should see a notice saying "Welcome to LNbits, set up the Superuser account below."

Come up with a username (e.g. admin), a good password and enter it into the fields. Save it in your password manager! You should be logged in right away.

Check on the left if you see the "Settings" option. Here you can configure your server further. Explore this!

**`Security notice:`** Anyone who has access to this wallet also has access to sensitive data on your server and can fill any wallet on the LNbits server with sats from your node. It is therefore recommended to store the password separately in a password manager.

Now let's make a regular user. Go to your LNbits installation, such as [https://lnbits.nodeacademy.org](https://lnbits.nodeacademy.org). Enter a wallet name, such as your name, and click on "Add New Wallet." Under "My Account" in the top right you can retrieve your user ID (not do share this), set your password and configure other security measures. As the admin, you are not just responsible for your own wallet, but also those of your users. In the admin panel, see whether you want to allow users to create their own accounts in your instance, and how they should authenticate them.

All extensions need to be first installed by the admin user. Then they can be enabled by each individual user.

To add funds into your wallet, you can use the Admin user. Next to the balance is a `+` sign. This lets you change the balance of the admin wallet, from where you can send it out to individual users. Be careful not to "create" more funds than you have in your Lightning node!
