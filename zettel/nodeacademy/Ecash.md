Ecash

Ecash is a privacy preserving cryptographically-secured form of electronic cash. It differs from Bitcoin in that anybody can issue their own ecash through what is called a mint. Users of a mint can send each other ecash without the issuer being able to trace the payments. When receiving ecash from untrusted mints, users typically instantly redeem the ecash for either Lightning payments, either into their own wallet, or for ecash in a mint they trust. In that way ecash is similar to a custodial Lightning wallet like LNbits, but hard for the issuer to track and audit.

### Careful

Before running an ecash mint, be aware that due to the software's inherent private nature, it can be difficult for you to audit your own mint, including the outstanding ecash. You are unable to control who your users are, how they transact and therefor may be unable to shut down your ecash mint without rugpulling your users.
