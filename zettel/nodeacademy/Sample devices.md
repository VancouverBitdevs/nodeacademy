Great sample devices:

- Used laptop such as a Lenovo ThinkPad
- Refurbished desktop computer such as a Dell Precision 
- Workstation
- Mini-PC such as a Beelink Mini
- Raspberry Pi 4 or newer

For the installation process we will need a screen and keyboard. Once we have set up our device, these can be disconnected. A screen and keyboard are not required for raspberry pis or devices specifically intended to be run as servers.

We are very flexible as to our requirements. More RAM will will let you handle more channels, more CPU power will let you sync the blockchain faster. We will need about 80GB of space for the Bitcoin blockchain alone, plus about 30GB of storage for the operating system, Lightning and eventual side applications and tools.
